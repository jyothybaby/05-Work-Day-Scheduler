<b># 05-Work-Day-Scheduler</b><br>
Workday scheduler is used for creating a simple calender that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

 Here, I have used moment.js library for generating date and time. 
 Colors i have used to represent in the Workday scheduler,


 Past: Time section - Gray, Text area - light Gray
 present: time section - none (No color) , text area - Yellow
 Future : Time section: Green, Text-area - light green.

 Used Bootstap Api and monent.js Api for completing the application.

 For this project i have created three files, index.html, style.css, script.js.

 In script.js,
 1. Used JQuery for developing the codes.
 2. Used Moment.js for generating the time and dates for this application.
 3. Used LocalStorage for storing the data.
 4. Implemented the logic for showing the current date, time and day.
 5. implemented the logic for showing past, present and future using Moment.js.

 In index.html file,
 1. Used Bootstrap for creating the Header and scheduler row.
 2. The time from 9.00am to 5.00pm is STATIC. 
 In style.css,
 1. Made styles as per the requirements.
